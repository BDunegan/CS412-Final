### CS412 Final Django Project

This project was completed in the Fall semester of 2024 at Boston University. 
The project utilizes a *Django* web framework and a default *sqlite database* to store the names of authors and their associated works. 
Additionally, each author can register themselves on the site to leave comments and reviews of other peoples work!
